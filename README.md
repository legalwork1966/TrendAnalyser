# TrendAnalyser
The Trend Analyzer is an improvement on some professional work I did briefly for a client. It filters stocks using a Quandl API key and based on given criteria then 
creates predictions based on an optimized ANN. This is free software and I am not attempting to syndicate or distribute anyone's data here. As such, you must purchase your own Quandl key or obtain a free temporary one to operate this.
