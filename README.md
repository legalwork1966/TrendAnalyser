# TrendAnalyser
The Trend Analyzer is an improvement on some professional work I did briefly for a client. It filters stocks using a Quandl API key and based on given criteria then 
creates predictions based on an optimized Keras ANN. Essentially, I structured the ANN as a hierarchy so ideally , and with some tweaking, the decisions would filter up the neural network until they reached a critical point and made the decision.
