# TrendAnalyser
The Trend Analyzer written by A. Marinello is an expansion of some earlier work. It filters stocks using a Quandl API key and based on given criteria then creates predictions based on an optimized ANN. This is an old project, there have been many iterations of it since and I no longer use the Quandl API as it's, in my opinion, very expensive. The intent is to upload this to a Flask or Django service.
